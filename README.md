# Enterprise Network Topology Project

## Overview

This project showcases a scalable and efficient network topology tailored for both small and large enterprises. The design implements advanced networking concepts, ensuring robust security, seamless communication, and high availability. Using **Packet Tracer**, we have built a network that includes features like VLAN segmentation, HSRP redundancy, inter-VLAN routing, and more.

## Network Topology

The network comprises the following key components:

- **Core Layer**: Two Layer 3 switches configured with HSRP for redundancy.
- **Distribution Layer**: Strategically placed switches and routers for VLAN segregation and routing.
- **Access Layer**: Devices connected to designated VLANs for various departments, such as Marketing, HR, Sales, and Accounting.
- **Server Farm**: A dedicated VLAN hosting DHCP, DNS, and Web Servers.
- **WAN Connectivity**: OSPF and BGP protocols are used for external communication with external networks.

**Key IP ranges**:
- Cairo LAN: `192.168.0.0/16`
- Alex LAN: `172.16.0.0/16`
- External Networks: Subnetted IPs between `10.0.0.0/24` to `16.0.0.0/24`.

## Features

### Basic Configuration
- Hostname assignments for all devices.
- User and privileged passwords set.
- SSH accessibility configured for secure remote access.

### Switching
1. **VLAN Configuration**:
   - VLANs created for departments like Marketing, Sales, HR, and more.
   - Management VLAN for device administration.
2. **Port Configuration**:
   - Ports set as access or trunk (static trunks with DTP disabled).
3. **Inter-VLAN Routing**:
   - Routing implemented on Layer 3 switches for communication between VLANs.
4. **Security Features**:
   - Port security to prevent unauthorized devices.
   - DHCP snooping and ARP security for IP integrity.
5. **HSRP**:
   - Configured for redundancy between core switches.
6. **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**:
   - Enhanced with security measures.

### Routing
1. **Dynamic Routing Protocols**:
   - OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP configured for communication within and outside the network.
   - Inter-protocol communication ensured.
2. **NAT**:
   - Configured for external internet access.
3. **ACL**:
   - Applied to control traffic flow and enforce network security.
4. **DHCP Server**:
   - Centralized DHCP for automatic IP address assignment.
5. **VLAN Isolation**:
   - Prevented unauthorized communication between VLANs.

## Deployment

The project is simulated using **Packet Tracer** and supports real-world deployment. It incorporates fault-tolerant designs and allows for future scalability, making it ideal for enterprise-grade networking.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of wireless access points.
- Network monitoring tools (e.g., SNMP, Syslog).
- Implementation of SD-WAN for dynamic traffic optimization.
